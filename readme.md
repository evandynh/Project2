###Approach Taken <br>
During this project, I used gems like "cocoon", "bootstrap-sass", "twitter-bootstrap-rails". <br>
- Cocoon: Used it to add a link to add a piece of form, to add more Skills in case the user needs it. <br>
- Bootstrap-sass: Used it to add style with SASS. <br>
- Twitter-bootstrap-rails: Used it to add the slide of images in the home page.

I also got to understand more about nested routes and permissions of each user.

Styles and links between views to give the user a fluid site navigation.

AWS is used to upload images for the profile picture of the user.

###Unsolved Problems <br>
Add Navbar for different aspects of the company, not enough time to do it.
